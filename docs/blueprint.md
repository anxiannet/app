## Core Features:

- Game Rooms and Role Assignment: Establish game rooms that can be joined by players and distribute roles after the game starts. According to the number of players, assign roles and control the game flow. After the game starts, players will select a captain. The first captain is random, and subsequent captains rotate.
- WeChat Login: Allow users to log in using their WeChat accounts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A020F0) to convey excitement and energy, drawing inspiration from retro arcade games but steering clear of excessive neon. This color must contrast the light background.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, creating a clean, modern look to ensure readability and contrast.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), placed slightly to the "left" of purple in the color wheel. Use sparingly for interactive elements and highlights, adding a jolt of energy without overwhelming the design.
- Clear, readable sans-serif font for game titles and descriptions.
- Use clean, simple icons to represent game genres and other categories.
- Subtle animations on hover for game tiles and buttons.
